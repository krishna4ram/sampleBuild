# r-docker-workflow
This is a sample project for showing how to set up all the basic elements needed for a complete Continuous Integration (CI) for developing and deploying R code.
It combines R, RStudio, GitHub, Docker, Docker Hub, CricleCI and DigitalOcean, but it can easily be changed or expanded to include other services.
It is intended a starting point for anyone who wants to deploy R solutions professionally using moderne CI magic.
Enjoy!
:-)
